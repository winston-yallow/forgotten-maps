# Forgotten Maps

Small game made for the Godot Wild Jam \#57. The player has to restore a map by placing location markers on a blank paper.


## Development

### Repo Structure
The `project` directory contains the Godot project. It only uses GDScript, so you don't need the Godot mono version.
I use Godot 4.0.3 but it should probably work with any 4.0.x version.
The `scripts` directory contains helper scripts to automate exporting and uploading the project to the itch.io page.
The `version.txt` will be used as the source of truth for the version info. When changing it, a git tag for the version
should be created too.

### Contributing
Please open an issue first to ask if something is wanted. I already have some changes planned so it's best to coordinate
first. Other than that, feel free to play around with the code!
