text = "You are a cartographer tasked to restore the lost maps of an island. As tools you only have your compass, two rulers and some paper to draw the map on.

In the map view you can draw the area surrounding you. To do that, you need to know where you are first so that you draw your surroundings at the correct location.

The best way to find out where you are is to look at a landmark to see the compass direction it is at. Then place a ruler on the map with the same direction (you know that you are somewhere on that line). Now do this process for a second landmark. You should now have two rulers on your map, each aligned with the real world direction to the landmark. These two lines should intersect somewhere: That is your current location.

You can now click the \"Extend Map\" button in the bottom. Then click on the map where you are (the intersection). Confirming the placed marker will update the map by automatically drawing your surrounding area around your placed marker."
